# Vendored: webauthn-json

This package is vendored from [webauthn-json](https://github.com/github/webauthn-json), commit sha `e932b3585fa70b0bd5b5a4012ba7dbad7b0a0d0f`.

This package was vendored because it is exported as an ESModule, which is incompatible with the rest of the SDK.

The package is "feature complete", so updates shouldn't be necessary, but in case updates are necessary, just re-copy and paste the contents of each file from the current head to the file here that shares the same name.
